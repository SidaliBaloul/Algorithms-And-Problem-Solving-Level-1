# Algorithms-And-Problem-Solving-Level-1

🧠 Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 1
The first step toward building logic & programming fundamentals

This repository contains my solutions to Level 1 algorithmic problems, which represent the very beginning of structured problem-solving practice.
These exercises follow the ProgrammingAdvices.com learning roadmap and are designed to help build a strong foundation before moving to higher levels.

🎯 Goal of Level 1

Level 1 focuses on developing basic logical thinking and understanding how to translate simple ideas into working code.
The problems here help practice:

Basic input & output

Simple calculations

Very straightforward decision-making

Translating a problem statement into a sequence of steps

These small tasks build the mental foundation required for more complex algorithms later.

📘 What This Level Covers
✔️ Very Basic Algorithms

Simple math operations

Basic conditions (if/else)


✔️ Fundamental Programming Skills

Understanding variables

Reading and printing data

Writing the simplest functions

Clean, readable code

✔️ Early Logic Building

The problems are intentionally easy. Their purpose is to train consistency, accuracy, and structured thinking.
